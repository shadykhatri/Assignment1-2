            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>My journey in web development has been a blend of educational pursuits and hands-on experience, shaping me into the professional I am today.

                Beginning with my high school graduation in 2018, I embarked on a journey fueled by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. My dedication to learning led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications, which I proudly achieved in 2022. However, my passion for growth didn't end there; I dove headfirst into the world of Full Stack Software Development, eager to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges.
                
                Simultaneously, my career in web development was taking off. Starting as a Junior Developer in 2018, I immersed myself in projects, learning valuable lessons with each line of code. Transitioning to a Web Developer role in 2019 allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in real-world scenarios, crafting immersive digital experiences for users across various platforms.
                
                With each role came new responsibilities and opportunities for growth. In 2022, I was honored to step into the shoes of a Senior Developer, where I now lead projects and mentor aspiring developers, paying forward the guidance I received earlier in my career.
                
                Today, I stand at the intersection of education and experience, driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web development. My journey is a testament to the power of determination and the transformative impact of continuous learning in shaping the digital landscape.
